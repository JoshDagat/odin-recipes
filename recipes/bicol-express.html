    <p>Insert mandatory life experience anecdote here.</p>


    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul class="ingredients">
      <li>1kg pork belly sliced into thin cubes</li>
      <li>2 cups coconut milk</li>
      <li>2 cups coconut cream</li>
      <li>1/2 cup shrimp paste (optional, allergens)</li>
      <li>4 cloves garlic crushed</li>
      <li>6 pieces Thai chili pepper (or more if you like spicy)</li>
      <li>1 thumb ginger minced</li>
      <li>1 piece onion chopped</li>
      <li>1 piece Serrano pepper sliced (more if you like spicy)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Saut√© the onions, garlic and ginger. Once all the natural sugars have come out. Place the pork in.</li>
      <li>Color the pork on medium to high heat. Season with salt and pepper. Don't add too much salt at this point if you plan to use shrimp paste.</li>
      <li>Once there's good color on your pork and it's juices have come out. Place in your shrimp paste and let the juices reduce. If you don't want to use shrimp paste, just reduce the juices.</li>
      <li>After reducing, add in your coconut milk and let it simmer on low heat. Keep stirring so the coconut milk doesn't curdle and burn.</li>
      <li>Keep reducing the sauce till it thickens. If the pork is still tough, you can add some more water, as long as you reduce it back down.</li>
      <li>When you're happy with the consistency and the pork is tender, add in the coconut cream and the chilies.</li>
      <li>Don't cook for too long once you add in the cream, otherwise it will start releasing oil.</li>
      <li>Plate up and sprinkle the Serrano pepper on top.</li>
    </ol>
