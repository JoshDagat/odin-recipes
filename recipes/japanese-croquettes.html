    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>3 Large Potatoes (Russet Potatoes work's best)</li>
      <li>1 small onion minced</li>
      <li>250g beef minced</li>
      <li>1 tbsp soy sauce</li>
      <li>1 tbsp mirin</li>
      <li>3 tbsp mayonnaise (Japanese Kewpie recommended)</li>
      <li>2 eggs, whisked</li>
      <li>plain flour</li>
      <li>breadcrumbs</li>
      <li>tonkatsu sauce (You can use any other sauce you like)</li>
      <li>shredded cabage, or salad of choice</li>
      <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Boil your potatoes till soft. Don't forget to season the water with salt.</li>
      <li>In a pan, saut√© the onions over high heat. Add a pinch of salt to help them cook faster.</li>
      <li>Add in the beef and stir till you get good color on your meat. Color = flavour.</li>
      <li>Add in the soy sauce, mirin and pepper. Simmer until most of the liquid has evaporated.</li>
      <li>Going back to your potatoes, drain the water out and place back on heat. This step helps remove most of the moisture.</li>
      <li>Mash your potatoes, add the cooked beef in as well as the mayonnaise and mix well. At this point, let it cool.</li>
      <li>Once the mixture has cooled, start shaping your portions</li>
      <li>Take some of the mixture in your hands and start rolling into balls.</li>
      <li>Flatten the ball to create a disc. It's best not to make the disc too thick for better crispness.</li>
      <li>Coat the Korokke mixture in flour and place in the fridge for a minimum of 15 mins. This step helps them keep their shape.</li>
      <li>Take out your Korokke discs. Dip them in the egg, make sure to cover the entire disc. Dip them bag in flour, then the egg, then finally the breadcrumbs.</li>
      <li>On a deep enough pan, heat up some oil. Make sure you use medium-high heat to prevent burning. Drop in a piece of breadcrumb, if the oil bubbles around then it's ready</li>
      <li>Place your Korokkes one at a time. Make sure not to overcrowd the pan.</li>
      <li>Your Korokokes are ready once they turn a nice golden brown color.</li>
      <li>Drain on a wire rack or kitchen paper.</li>
      <li>Serve with shredded cabbage or salad of choice. Use sauce as liked.</li>
    </ol>
