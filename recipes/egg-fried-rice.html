    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Uncle Roger approves.</p>

    <p>Egg fried rice is an Asian's comfort food. The base recipe needs only eggs, rice, salt and pepper. This simplicity is what makes it such a versatile dish. You can literally add anything you like, and the end result would still be palatable. (Hopefully) </p>

    <p>This is our take, on Egg Fried Rice</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 Eggs whisked</li>
      <li>Leftover Rice (Freshly cooked rice works, but leftovers are the best)</li>
      <li>Onions minced</li>
      <li>Garlic smashed (Do not peel)</li>
      <li>Salt and Pepper to taste</li>
      <li>2 tbsp soy sauce</li>
      <li>spring onions/scallions to taste</li>
      <li>(optional) Any form or protein</li>
      <li>(optional) Any vegetables diced</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>In a hot pan (preferrably a wok) sauté your aromatics. Onions, garlic, and a little bit of the spring onions.</li>
      <li>I found that sautéing your garlic with peel on helps infuse the garlic better into your dish.</li>
      <li>Add a little bit of salt here, it helps the onions cook faster.</li>
      <li>Add in your rice. Heat is your friend with fried rice, so don't be afraid to put your stove on high heat. Keep stirring to prevent burning.</li>
      <li>You should be able to see your rice 'dancing' as the water inside gets heated. Keep tossing your rice till you get a slight color change.</li>
      <li>If you want to have scrispy bits, flattern your rice on the wok and leave for a minute or so. This leaves a thin crust on your rice.</li>
      <li>Add in your soy sauce. Sprinkle the soy sauce around the edge of the pan. This helps infuse a charry soy sauce flavor into your egg fried rice.</li>
      <li>Add your eggs in small batches, then stir. This helps coat individual rice grains instead of having clumps of egg. This method, produces fluffier egg fried rice.</li>
      <li>Taste. Adjust with salt and pepper.</li>
      <li>Turn off the heat and add in the spring onions/scallions</li>
      <li>(optional) Add in your cooked proteins and vegetables and stir.</li>
    </ol>
